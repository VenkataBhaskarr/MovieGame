# MovieGame(Under Construction 😁)


## How I came up with the Idea 

So one fine day i was coming home by our college bus and the our friends started playing the game that we shpuld identify the actors and movie name by theri starting letters so i thought that there should b an application that would do that job for us 🙂


## Idea

We will use python package to scrape the data of movies from 2015 till now from IMDB website and make a dataset with the movie name and actors and then we can query the starting letters to get the data rows satisfying the conditions.
